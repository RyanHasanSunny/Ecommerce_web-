# Update Product Pricing Logic

## Tasks
- [x] Update calculateFinalPrice to return calculateSellingPrice() since discount is now included in sellingPrice
- [x] Remove separate "Selling Price" and "Final Price" sections in Price Summary, show only "Final Price"
- [x] Update product preview to show only final price without strike-through or save amount

## Information Gathered
- ProductManagement.jsx handles pricing calculations
- calculateSellingPrice includes unit price + profit + delivery charge - offer value
- Previously finalPrice was sellingPrice - offerValue, but now sellingPrice already includes discount

## Plan
1. Modify calculateFinalPrice function to simply return calculateSellingPrice()
2. Update Price Summary Card to remove the separate selling price display and divider
3. Simplify preview price display to show only the final price

## Dependent Files
- frontend/src/admin_panel/pages/ProductManagement.jsx

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Test pricing calculations with different values
- [ ] Verify preview shows correct pricing
- [ ] Check form submission includes correct finalPrice

## Completed Changes
- Updated calculateFinalPrice to return calculateSellingPrice() directly
- Simplified Price Summary to show only the final price calculation
- Removed strike-through pricing and save amount from product preview

# Add Net Profit Display in Product Pricing

## Tasks
- [x] Add "Net Profit" line in price summary showing profit - offerValue
- [x] Display net profit in info color to distinguish from final price

## Information Gathered
- Net profit = intended profit - discount (offerValue)
- Currently profit is fixed input, offerValue reduces selling price
- Net profit helps track actual profit after discounts

## Plan
1. Add a line in the Price Summary Card for "Net Profit" = profit - offerValue
2. Use info color for the net profit display
3. Position it before the final price divider

## Dependent Files
- frontend/src/admin_panel/pages/ProductManagement.jsx

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Test net profit calculation with different offer values
- [ ] Consider adding promo code support in future if needed

## Completed Changes
- Added "Net Profit" display in price summary showing profit minus offer value
- Used info color (blue) to differentiate from final price
- Positioned before the final price for clear hierarchy
