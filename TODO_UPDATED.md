# TODO: Update Customer Paid Display Logic - COMPLETED

## Major Change: Customer Paid Amount Display
- **Goal**: Show actual amount paid (advance for COD, full for non-COD) instead of total amount
- **Scope**: User panel and Admin panel order displays

## Tasks Completed:
- [x] Update OrderList.jsx (Admin Panel)
  - Change "Total: order.totalAmount" to "Customer Paid: order.paidAmount"
  - Add "Due: order.dueAmount" when dueAmount > 0
  - Update table column headers and data display

- [x] Update OrderPage.jsx (User Panel)
  - Change "Total Amount: order.totalAmount" to "Customer Paid: order.paidAmount"
  - Add due amount display when applicable
  - Update order summary section

- [x] Update OrderDetailPage.jsx (User Panel)
  - Change "Total: order.totalAmount" to "Customer Paid: order.paidAmount"
  - Add due amount display in order summary
  - Update payment information section

- [x] Test Changes
  - Verify COD orders show advance as customer paid + due
  - Verify non-COD orders show full amount as customer paid
  - Check both user and admin panels

## Files Modified:
1. frontend/src/admin_panel/pages/OrderList.jsx ✅
2. frontend/src/user-panel/pages/OrderPage.jsx ✅
3. frontend/src/user-panel/pages/OrderDetailPage.jsx ✅

## Backend Status:
- ✅ Backend logic already correct (paidAmount = advance for COD, full for non-COD)
- ✅ Due amount calculation correct
- ✅ No backend changes needed

## Summary of Changes:
- **Admin Panel (OrderList.jsx)**: Updated table to show "Customer Paid" column with paidAmount and "Due Amount" column with dueAmount when applicable
- **User Panel (OrderPage.jsx)**: Updated order list to show "Customer Paid: paidAmount" with due amount when applicable
- **User Panel (OrderDetailPage.jsx)**: Updated order summary to show "Customer Paid: paidAmount" with due amount when applicable
- **PaymentModal.jsx**: Already correctly shows advance payment and due for COD orders

All changes maintain consistency across the application and correctly display the amount actually paid by the customer (advance for COD, full amount for non-COD) along with any outstanding due amounts.
